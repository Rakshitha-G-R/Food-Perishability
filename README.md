# Food-Perishability
ML code to predict if food is perishable or not using two parameters-moisture(in %) and temperature(in celcius).
If the entered temperature is below 11째C the food has lesser chance of perishing irrespective of it's moisture content.
If the temperature is above 11 and the moisture content is below 15% then the food item may or may not be perishable.
If the moisture content is above 15% and the temperature is above 11째C but below 29째C then the food would still be perishable.
When the temperature is above 29째C the food would get spoilt irrespective of it's moisture content.
